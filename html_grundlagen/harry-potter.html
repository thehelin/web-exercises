<p>Over the course of 10 years, J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. brought the world of Harry Potter to life on the big
    screen with eight films based on the author’s blockbuster books. The series has grossed nearly $8 billion in
    theaters worldwide, with the three spinoff Fantastic Beasts films tallying another $2 billion, give or take, over
    another six years.

    Rowling, while enthusiastic about the movies, has written that “It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of
    my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long.”

    Warner Bros. Discovery may have found a solution to that dilemma with an expansive, Lord of the Rings-style TV
    series based on Harry Potter. Or, per our latest reporting, potentially multiple series. For everything you need to
