<h1> Harry Potter </h1>
<p> Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels follow the
    lives of Harry Potter, a young wizard studying at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and his friends
    Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. The main story is Harry's life struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard
    who is trying to become immortal, overthrow the wizarding board of directors known as the Ministry of Magic, and
    subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).</p>

<h2> Harry Potter 1 </h2>
<p> The lowest-grossing Harry Potter film, and the third in the series, is also widely regarded as the best by fans
    and
    critics. Director Alfonso Cuarón changed the look and feel of the Harry Potter world created by Chris Columbus
    in
    the first two films—enough to update it as the characters and the storylines mature, but not enough to turn off
    viewers. New faces in the 2004 flick include David Thewlis as one of the best teachers Harry ever has, Professor
    Lupin, plus the introduction of Gary Oldman as wrongfully convicted Sirius Black. Add in a werewolf, an escaped
    prisoner, time travel, Harry’s flight on a Hippogriff, a thrilling ride on the Knight Bus and the Marauder’s
    Map,
    and you’ve got a recipe for a fun-filled outing that Cuarón keeps moving at a quick pace for the best film in
    the
    franchise. The flick also contains one of the most memorable Harry Potter quotes: “I solemnly swear that I am up
    to
    no good.” </p>
